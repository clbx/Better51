# Better51
An 8051 Simulator + Assembler

I'm not working on this anymore due to working on Cosmic. The backbone is here, it just needs filling in.

I'd do a lot of things different if I started over again though.

# Things that need doing
Now

* Finish emulator

* Finish debugger

Later

* Reduce code resuse, find a better way to execute opcodes
